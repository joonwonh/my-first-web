        <h2>css란 무엇인가?</h2>
        <p><u><strong>Style Sheets (CSS)</strong></u> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
            written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).</p>
        <p>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>[2]CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p>
        <p>[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control
            in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
            by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition 
            in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed 
            between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
